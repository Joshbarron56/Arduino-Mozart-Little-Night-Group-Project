# Arduino-Mozart-Little-Night-Group-Project
Little Night programmed on in Arduino (C based language). As a group we had to read the sheet music and program it accordingly to play from a speaker with a light show. The small yellow LED turns on with every D6 note (the highest note). Our group received recognition for an outstanding demonstration and presentation on this project.
